#include <stdio.h> // Include standard input/output library

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize a character variable
    char myChar = 'A';
    // Declare and initialize an integer variable
    int myInt = 123;

    // The printf statement expects a format string and arguments corresponding to the format specifiers.
    // %c is for a character.
    // %d is for a signed decimal integer.
    // The original snippet was missing an argument for the second format specifier.
    printf("%c: %d\n", myChar, myInt); // Correct usage with two arguments

    // Example demonstrating the error from the user's snippet if 'I' was an integer
    // If 'I' was meant to be an integer, and only one argument was provided for two specifiers,
    // the behavior would be undefined.

    // Let's assume the user wanted to print a character and an integer.
    // If 'I' was an integer and they forgot the character:
    // char someChar = 'B';
    // int I_val = 456;
    // printf("%c: %d\n", someChar, I_val); // This would be a correct way to use two arguments

    // For the specific snippet: printf(“%c: %d”, I);
    // If 'I' was an character, it would be missing the integer argument.

    // A complete, working example:
    printf("This is a working example of printf with %%c and %%d:\n");
    char grade = 'B';
    int score = 85;
    printf("Grade: %c, Score: %d\n", grade, score);

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}
